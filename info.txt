We use WebRTC protocol which is a UDP(User Datagram protocol).

1. How does it work?
    i. Signalling -> SDP
    ii. Connecting -> ICE
    iii. Secureing -> DLTS , SRTP
    iv. Communicating -> RTP, SCTP


2. Use WebRTC API which are already most of them are build in browsers
    i. MediaStream  -> Access the  camara 
    ii. RTCPeerConnection -> build network for connection
    iii. RTCDataChannel -> build a data channel to communicate


3. WebRTC Architectures
    i. P2P(peer to peer) -> serverless Architectures
    ii. SFU(Selective forwarding Unit) -> 
    iii. MCU(Multi point control Unit)


4. MUST learn for this project (source ChatGPT)
    i. WebRTC
        -> Real-time communication protocol for 
            video, audio, and screen sharing.

    ii. Socket.IO
        -> Enables real-time, bidirectional communication
             between client and server for signaling

    iii. STUN/TURN server
        -> STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) 
            helps with NAT traversal.
        -> TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) is \
            required for relaying media in restrictive networks.

    iv. Media Streams API
        -> Captures video/audio from user devices

    v. And many more

    
Start coding:

1. Backend:
    i. npm install express mongoose nodemon bcrypt
    ii. npm i http-status socket.io
    iii. npm i cors --save
    iv. npm i crypto
    v. npm i jsonwebtoken
    vi. npm install dotenv



2. Frontend
    i. npm i react-router-dom
    ii. npm i web-vitals
    iii. npm i axios http-status socket.io-client
